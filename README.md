# Challenge1

## Description

This is Challenge #1 for the Columbia Coding Bootcamp. The goal is to edit the existing index.html and style.css files to simplify the code and reduce redundancies. In addition, I attempt to increase accessibility to the website. This Page lets me show my knowledge in CSS, by combining and clearing redundant code the CSS file looks much cleaner and easier for other programs to read and understand.
